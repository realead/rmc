### About

RMC is a register machine compiler, i.e. it compiles register machine code, right now the only supported target: x86_64 linux architecture. 


### Usage 

*gcc* and *python2.7* are necessary. gcc is used to assemble and link assembler code generated by rmc.

   2. run your executable with *./program*
